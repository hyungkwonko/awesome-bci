  "full_description": "This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 109 volunteers, each performing 14 experimental runs: two baseline runs (one with eyes open, one with eyes closed), and four runs of each of the following tasks: opening and closing left or right fist as specified by a cue on screen; imagining opening and closing left or right fist as specified by a cue on screen; and opening and closing both fists or both feet as specified by a cue on screen. Subjects were fitted with an EEG cap with 64 electrodes positioned according to the international 10-20 system, with a sampling rate of 160 Hz.",
