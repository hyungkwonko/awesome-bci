  "full_description": "This dataset contains intracortical neural recordings from one clinical trial participant (T5) with tetraplegia, collected using two 96-channel Blackrock Utah Arrays. The participant performed a sentence copying task in 21 sessions (11 for seed model training, 10 for online evaluation), where neural activity was decoded into text via a recurrent neural network and language model. The data demonstrate the effectiveness of the CORP (Continual Online Recalibration with Pseudo-labels) method, which allows seamless, self-updating BCI use over time without manual recalibration.",
