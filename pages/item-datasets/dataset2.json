  "description": "Neural data from intracortical recordings in a human participant performing unimanual and bimanual tasks for BCI control using recurrent neural networks.",
  "full_description": "This dataset includes intracortical neural recordings from a participant with tetraplegia implanted with two 96-channel Utah arrays in the motor cortex. The participant performed unimanual and bimanual movements in instructed delay tasks and real-time brain-computer interface (BCI) control of two independent cursors. The goal was to decode bimanual control using recurrent neural network models.",
