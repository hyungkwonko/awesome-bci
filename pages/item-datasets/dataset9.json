  "description": "Dataset from a study demonstrating continuous intracortical BCI control of three finger groups and virtual quadcopter navigation in an individual with tetraplegia.",
  "full_description": "This dataset supports a high-performance intracortical BCI study in a participant with tetraplegia, enabling real-time control of three independent finger groups, including 2D thumb movements, for a total of four degrees of freedom. The participant completed target-reaching tasks at a high throughput and used decoded finger positions to control a virtual quadcopter through obstacle courses. The work emphasizes both technical advancement and user-centered goals such as recreation and social participation. Data includes finger kinematics, target tracking, neural features, and performance metrics.",
