  "description": "Neural recordings from a single participant using a Utah array BCI to decode attempted handwriting into text. Achieved record typing speeds for BCIs using RNN-based decoding.",
  "full_description": "This dataset contains neural activity recorded from a single participant with paralysis using two implanted 96-channel Utah arrays in the hand area of motor cortex. The participant attempted to handwrite 1,000 sentences (43,501 characters) across 10.7 hours. Neural signals were decoded into text using a recurrent neural network, achieving up to 90 characters per minute at 94.1% accuracy online, and over 99% accuracy offline with autocorrect. Includes real-time BCI outputs.",
