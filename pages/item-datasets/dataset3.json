  "full_description": "This dataset includes recordings using Neuropixels probes from the human cortex during intraoperative procedures. Single-neuron activity was captured at high spatiotemporal resolution in three human participants, yielding over 200 well-isolated units per session. Data were collected using open-source acquisition (SpikeGLX), sorting (Kilosort 3.0, Phy2), and analysis tools (MATLAB, Python, Fieldtrip). Probe localization was reconstructed with Blender, Mango, and MMVT. The study characterizes neural waveforms, firing dynamics, and interactions with LFP events.",
