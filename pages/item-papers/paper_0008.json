  "abstract": "Serruya et al. test in an N-of-1 trial whether a wearable, powered exoskeletal orthosis, driven by a percutaneous, implanted brainâ€“computer interface can restore voluntary upper extremity function following chronic hemiparesis subsequent to a cerebral subcortical stroke. Using this approach, voluntary opening of the paralyzed hand is restored.",
