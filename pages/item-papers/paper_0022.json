  "abstract": "Karvat et al. describe a real-time digital signal-processing method to detect neural oscillations in the form of short and narrowband bursts. Using this real-time method, they show that neurofeedback increases burst-related behaviours and that these bursts can be decoded from the movements of the rats.",
