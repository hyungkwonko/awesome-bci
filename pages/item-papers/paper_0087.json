  "abstract": "Owing to recent advances in brain–machine interfaces and electrical stimulation of the spinal cord, restoration motor function in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) has become a reality. Jackson and Zimmerman review the mechanisms underlying closed-loop interfaces—in which electrical stimulation is driven by neural output—as prostheses, and propose that such devices enhance neural plasticity, thereby providing long-term therapeutic benefits to patients with SCI.",
