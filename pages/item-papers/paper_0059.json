  "abstract": "Using a rodent neuroprosthetic model, the authors found that, after successful learning, task-related units specifically experienced increased locking and coherency to SWA during sleep, and spike-spike coherence among these units was significantly enhanced. These changes were not present with poor skill acquisition or after control awake periods, demonstrating specificity to learning.",
