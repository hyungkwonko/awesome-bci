  "abstract": "Speech-related neural modulation was recently reported in the 'arm/hand' area of human dorsal motor cortex used for intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs). This study assessed whether such modulation interferes with iBCI control. A BrainGate2 clinical trial participant used an iBCI to control a cursor and spoke short words during and outside of task performance. Neural activity modulated during speech alone, but this was attenuated when speaking during iBCI use. Decoder-relevant components of speech-related activity were minimal, resulting in unchanged cursor performance. Thus, speaking does not interfere with iBCI use based on attempted arm movement.",
