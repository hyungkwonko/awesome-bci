  "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress and interest in brain-machine interfaces that restore motor function, the performance of prosthetic fingers and limbs has yet to mimic native function. Here, the authors demonstrate that shallow-layer neural network decoders outperform and enable higher velocity finger movements than the current linear decoding standard.",
