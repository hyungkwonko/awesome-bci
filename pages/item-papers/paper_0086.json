  "abstract": "This technical report describes a 360-channel flexible multi-electrode array with high spatial resolution, wide coverage area and minimal damage to the recorded neural tissue. Among other descriptions of multiunit in vivo neuronal recording in cats, the authors also use the electrode array to show spiral-patterned spread of epileptic neural activity in the neocortex.",
