  "abstract": "In-ear visual and auditory brain-computer interfaces typically have issues with poor interfacial adhesion or user irritation. Here, Wang et al. presents an in-ear hollow bioelectronic device that adaptively conforms to the ear canal, under electrothermal actuation, for electroencephalogram sensing.",
