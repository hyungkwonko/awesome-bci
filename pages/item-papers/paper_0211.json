  "abstract": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to restore communication for people with tetraplegia and anarthria by translating neural activity into control signals for assistive communication devices. In this study, a high-performance intracortical BCI (iBCI) was evaluated in three clinical trial participants with paralysis. The system incorporated advances in decoder design from prior research, enabling typing rates and information throughput surpassing previous human clinical BCI performance by 1.4–4.2× and 2.2–4.0×, respectively. These results highlight the clinical potential of iBCIs for communication in individuals with severe motor impairments.",
