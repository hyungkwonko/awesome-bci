  "abstract": "As one of the important brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigms, motor imagery (MI) enables the control of external devices via identification of motor intention by decoding the features of Electroencephalography (EEG). Movement imagination of multi-types of joints from the same limb allows the development of more accurate and intuitive BCI systems. In this work, we reported an open dataset including EEG and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings from 18 subjects performing eight MI tasks from four types of joints including hand open/close, wrist flexion/extension, wrist abduction/adduction, elbow pronation/supination, elbow flexion/extension, shoulder pronation/supination, shoulder abduction/adduction, and shoulder flexion/extension, resulting in a total of 5760 trials. The validity of multi-modal data was verified both from the EEG/fNIRS activation patterns and the classification performance. It is expected that this dataset will facilitate the development and innovation of decoding algorithms for MI of multi-types of joints based on multi-modal EEG-fNIRS data.",
