  "abstract": "Matiar Jafari, Tyson Aflalo et al. show that the human primary somatosensory cortex is activated when subjects imagine reaches in a cognitive motor task, but not when they plan movement or imagine a static limb position. These results highlight a role for this region in cognitive imagery and motor control in the absence of sensory information.",
