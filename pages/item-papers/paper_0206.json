  "abstract": "This study evaluates the potential of intracortical electrode array signals for BCIs to restore speech. Two participants with chronically implanted 96-electrode arrays spoke 420 words representing 39 English phonemes. Decoders were trained to classify phoneme identities from neural signals and synthesize speech via a neural pattern matching method. A linear decoder achieved 29.3% accuracy, and an RNN achieved 33.9%. Speech synthesis reached a 0.523 correlation with true audio. The findings suggest that even nontraditional speech areas like the dorsal precentral gyrus hold promise for future speech BCIs.",
