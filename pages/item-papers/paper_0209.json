  "abstract": "When using an intracortical BCI (iBCI), users modulate their neural population activity to move an effector towards a target, stop accurately, and correct for movement errors—behavior governed by 'feedback control policies.' This study analyzed how three participants in the BrainGate2 trial used an iBCI in a 2D cursor task with a velocity decoder. Offline modeling showed that participants' neural responses varied with cursor state and target position, adapting to changes in decoder gain and smoothing. Findings challenge prior assumptions and offer a refined model of neural control for improved BCI decoder design.",
