  "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous Neural Decoding (BRAND), a Linux-based, modular, and language-agnostic platform. BRAND uses Redis for fast inter-process communication, enabling parallel execution across asynchronous streams. In tests, BRAND demonstrated sub-millisecond latencies and supported real-time brain-computer interface operation in a clinical setting. The framework lowers integration barriers for modern machine learning tools in neuroscience experiments.",
